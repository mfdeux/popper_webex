Popper
==========

Retrieve academic articles from SciHub with the click of a button. Popper is a web extension that can be added to any browser that supports the web extension API (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, etc)

The name Popper is inspired from the philosopher/professor of science [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper).

## Installation instructions:

1. Download the Popper repo to your local machine.

2. Open the extensions directory [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

3. Enable developer mode by clicking the toggle in the top right.

4. Click on the 'Load unpacked' button in the top right.

5. Find the Popper git repo on your local machine and click on the 'src' directory in the repo.


## Using Popper:

### Browser Button

Click on the Popper browser button in the top right of the browser (looks like an atomic symbol) and the article from SciHub will open in a new tab, current tab or will directly download the pdf, depending on the settings for the extension. The default action is to open the article in a new tab. This option can be changed, as described in 'Setting options' below.

### Context menu

Right click on any page or link on a page to access the Popper extension, whereby you can open the article from SciHub in a new tab, the current tab, or directly download the PDF.

Note: only click on pages containing articles/abstracts.

## Setting options:

Set the current SciHub domain and browser button action (i.e. open article in New Tab, Current Tab, or Download PDF) by going to the options for the Popper extension. You can access options by going to the chrome://extensions page and clicking on the Popper extension details or by right clicking on the Popper browser button and selecting 'Options'.

## Current SciHub domains:

SciHub domains rotate often. If the domain in your settings returns an error, perform a google search to find the active and working domains.
